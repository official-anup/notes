Q)what is the most challenging situation you face ?
---------------------------------------------------
-Actually there was one situation when the person who started this project initially as a front-end 
developer left so my manager asked me to take his duties as well till the time we find another resource
so i contributed as a front-end developer in this project for a while although i had no knowledge in html 
css ,javascript or bootstrap but i learned all those technologies and implemented the functionalities so it 
was a quite challenging situation for me at that moment.
